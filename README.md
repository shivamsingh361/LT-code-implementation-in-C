# LT code implementation in C
The file transfer has been implemented considering unreliability or erasure channel and LT code has been used to recover missing or dropped or corrupted packets. For file transfer the file has been broken into packets of fixed size and all these packets along with one more packet containing the XOR of all the packets has been sent. On the receiver side, the implemented file transfer recovers any one of missing packets irrespective of  total number of packets of the file, i.e the size of the file. I have shown the instance of file transfer of size 13kB (13 packets has been encoded in 14 packets using LT code) in which the erroneous packet no 3 is dropped and still file has been recovered without any retransmission. The erasure channel is emulated by randomly dropping any packet of file to be transmitted. 
The work can be further augmented for file transfer of any size with minimum overhead required to encode the packets using the Fountain code LT. The LT code is comparatively easy to implement because it uses only XOR operation. This code has very applicable in frequency hopping environment and multicasting transmission where retransmission is not possible to implement efficiently.
